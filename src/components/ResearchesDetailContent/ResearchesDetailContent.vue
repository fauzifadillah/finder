      Provisional ballots are intended to provide fail-safe protection for
      voters when there are questions about their registration status on
      Election Day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) became law in 2002, all states have
      been required to use provisional ballots. The only exception is states
      that offered same-day registration when the National Voter Registration
      Act was enacted in 1993, and even most of these states have found them
      useful in certain situations.

    <p>
      In its most basic form, a provisional ballot works like this: A voter
      whose name doesn’t appear on the voter registration list at a precinct
      polling place on Election Day—but who believes she or he is, in fact,
      registered—may be offered a provisional ballot. After being marked, it's
      placed in a special secrecy envelope rather than in the ballot box. After
      the polls close, the registration status of the voter is determined. If
      the voter was in fact registered on Election Day, the ballot is removed
      from the secrecy envelope and counted just like any other ballot. If the
      voter wasn’t registered, the ballot remains in the secrecy envelope and is
      not counted.

      On July 26, this time team visited the Applied science to meet Prof. Chen
      Poki, Prof. Toyoko Imae, Assc. Prof. Masaki Ujihara, and Assc. Prof.
      Wei-Song Hung, for discussions regarding research, carried out in order to
      see the potential of cooperation between NTUST and SERVED. The theme of
      the research presented by Prof. Toyoko Imae is concerning Innovative
      science and technology, advanced materials and smart technology, whereas
      the Assc Prof. Wei-Song Hung exposes about the Tuneable composite
      interlayer spacing of FRS oxide-framework membrane for solvent
      dehydration. The second theme is a very relationship with conducted by
      Prof. Dr. Eng. I Made Joni in Print-G so that the future can be rearranged
      a plan of cooperation between UNPAD (Print-G) and NTUST.
